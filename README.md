 <summary><h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h2></summary>
My name is Markuss, and I am a Full-Stack developer. My first experience in programming began in 6th grade when I was introduced to Scratch. However, a classmate discouraged me, saying that pursuing a career in programming would be too difficult. As a result, I avoided it for a long time. It wasn't until 2022 that I started contemplating my career path and realized that my passion lay in computers and optimization.

I decided to give programming another chance and started with Python. Initially, I didn't think much of it, but I knew that building something meaningful required more than just a one-hour tutorial. So, I delved deeper and tackled challenging problems. It was when I successfully solved difficult problems and built useful applications like calculator, blackjack game, and snake game that I experienced a breakthrough. It felt incredibly rewarding.

From there, I embarked on various Python projects, including automation, web scraping, file reading, games, and quizzes. Eventually, I ventured into web development since it I've heard It's a skill you should have. However, after about three months of splitting my time between web development and Python, I had learned you should stick to one language and learn it well until you try other things. Thus, I decided to commit to web development. I did a bunch of tutorials from youtube, udemy courses and did a program called Odin Project which is project based. Learned basics of linux cli, git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, then learned Intermediate HTML, CSS Concepts and did a Full JavaScript course. After that I learned Advanced HTML and CSS, learning animations and responsive design, then moving to doing a Full React course, also did 2 small react native projects. Then started learning backend technology, learning NodeJS, REST API, MonogDB, GraphQL. After learning and practing a bunch I build personal projects which are were interesting to me cause they were actually usefull for myself. Like Charades word generator with database and Transfer Spotify songs to YouTube songs which I created for myself.

After sticking to web development and bulding many kinds of projects, to deepen my understanding of the underlying principles, I pursued a computer science course called CS50. The course goes in depth in various fundamental concepts and principles of computer science, providing a comprehensive understanding of programming, algorithms, data structures, and more. I learned that acquiring knowledge in a lower-level programming language like C establishes a strong base understanding of the fundamental workings of computers and software. Understanding these foundational principles is beneficial as it facilitates learning other languages more easily in the future.

Currently, I am motivated by a strong desire for continuous improvement. I actively seek opportunities to enhance my coding skills and avoid complacency with easy or repetitive tasks. Challenging projects that push me beyond my comfort zone are what I strive for, as they provide valuable opportunities to acquire new skills and expertise. Embracing new concepts, techniques, and technologies is a top priority for me as I continue to expand my knowledge base and enhance my abilities.
